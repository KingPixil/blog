			<p class="s-x-i">Life traps all of us into repetitive routines, forcing us to constantly be in the same situation with the same people.</p><p class="s-x-i">As younger children, people tell us that we are unique and encourage us to chase our dreams to make the world a better place.</p><p class="s-x-i">In our teen years, we are stuck in the constant loop of going to school with the same classes and people. We continually try and fail to find the time to do something meaningful. Even though we are capable of making sophisticated ideas that can potentially have a significant impact on the world around us, we tone down our dreams to make them seem more achievable. We create ambitious ideas, but when we try to spread them they are dismissed because of our age. A few popular bad examples have successfully failed us all by painting a stereotypical image in the mind of everyone else.</p><p class="s-x-i">Once we finally reach adulthood we pursue one passion and attempt to find a job. We fall into a routine of waking up, commuting to work, working long hours in front of a screen, and coming back to sleep to start the cycle over again. We distract ourselves to separate ourselves from reality without realizing the bigger picture.</p><p class="s-x-i">All for what?</p><p class="s-x-i">One day, we grow old and are hit with a stark realization — after spending the majority of our lives trapped in a routine we failed to get the time to try new things that made us happy. Instead, we were encouraged to do what everyone else did and spent our time doing one thing and repeated it every day until now.</p><p class="s-x-i">Nowadays we spend larger portions of our precious time staring at screens for entertainment to stop ourselves from thinking about what we actually need to do to solve the never-ending supply of problems the world has to offer.</p><p class="s-x-i">We need to go back to the times when we went outside because there was not anything to do inside — not the other way around. We need to communicate and have meaningful conversations with the people around us. We need to travel and explore the world to meet new people and have new experiences.</p><p class="s-x-i">Constantly learn new things while continuing pursuing the passions that truly make you happy to create a positive impact on this world.</p>
